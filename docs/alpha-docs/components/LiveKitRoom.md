# LiveKitRoom

The LiveKitRoom component provides the room context to all its child components. It is generally the starting point of your LiveKit app and the root of the LiveKit component tree. It provides the room state as a React context to all child components, so you don't have to pass it yourself.

## Usage

```tsx
<LiveKitRoom
 token='<livekit-token>'
 serverUrl='<url-to-livekit-server>'
 connect={true}
>
    {...}
</LiveKitRoom>
```

## Props

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| serverUrl | `string \| undefined` |  | URL to the LiveKit server. For example: `wss://<domain>.livekit.cloud` To simplify the implementation, `undefined` is also accepted as an intermediate value, but only with a valid string url can the connection be established. |
| token | `string \| undefined` |  | A user specific access token for a client to authenticate to the room. This token is necessary to establish a connection to the room. To simplify the implementation, `undefined` is also accepted as an intermediate value, but only with a valid string token can the connection be established. @see https://docs.livekit.io/cloud/project-management/keys-and-tokens/#generating-access-tokens |
