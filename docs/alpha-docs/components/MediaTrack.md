# MediaTrack

The MediaTrack component is responsible for rendering participant media tracks like `camera`, `microphone` and `screen_share`. This component must have access to the participant's context, or alternatively pass it a `Participant` as a property.  Children of this component are used as placeholders when the underlying (video) track is muted or not available

## Usage

```tsx
{...}
  <ParticipantTile>
    <MediaTrack source={Track.Source.Camera} />
    <MediaTrack source={Track.Source.Microphone} />
  </ParticipantTile>
{...}
```
