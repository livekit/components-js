# ParticipantLoop

The ParticipantLoop component loops over all or a filtered subset of participants to create a visual representation (`ParticipantTile`) and context for every participant. This component takes zero or more children. By providing your own `ParticipantTile` template as a child you have full control over the look and feel of your participant representations.

## Usage

```tsx
{...}
  <ParticipantLoop>
    {...}
  <ParticipantLoop />
{...}
```
