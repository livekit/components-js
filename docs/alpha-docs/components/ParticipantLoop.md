# ParticipantLoop

The ParticipantLoop component loops over all or a filtered subset of participants to create a visual representation and context for every participant. This component takes zero or more children. By providing your own template as a child you have full control over the look and feel of your participant representations. You could use this for example to create a list of participants.

## Usage

```tsx
{...}
  <ParticipantLoop>
    <ParticipantName />
  <ParticipantLoop />
{...}
```

## Props

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| filter | `((value: Participant, index: number, array: Participant[]) => unknown)` |  |  |
| filterDependencies | `unknown[]` |  | If your filter function is dependent on some external state, and you want it to be re-filtered whenever that external state changes, you will need to provide a dependency array with all of the external dependencies, just as you would on a React useEffect hook. |
| updateOnlyOn | `RoomEvent[]` |  | To optimize performance, you can use the updateOnlyOn property to decide on what RoomEvents the hook updates. By default it updates on all relevant RoomEvents to keep the returned participants array up to date. The minimal set of non-overwriteable RoomEvents is: [RoomEvent.ParticipantConnected, RoomEvent.ParticipantDisconnected, RoomEvent.ConnectionStateChanged] |
