# StartAudio

The StartAudio component is only visible when the browser blocks audio playback. This is due to some browser implemented autoplay policies. To start audio playback, the user must perform a user-initiated event such as clicking this button. As soon as audio playback starts, the button hides itself again.

## Usage

```tsx
<LiveKitRoom>
  <StartAudio>Click to allow audio playback</StartAudio>
</LiveKitRoom>
```
