# TileLoop

The TileLoop component loops all participants (or a filtered subset) to create a visual representation (`ParticipantTile`) and context for every participant. This component takes zero or more children. By providing your own `ParticipantTile` template as a child you have full control over the look and feel of your participant representations.  The first element of the sources array will always create a participant tile. The following sources will only show up if there's a track present for that source. This makes it possible for a ParticipantTile to always show up also when a participant hasn't yet published a camera track.

## Usage

```tsx
{...}
  <TileLoop>
    {...}
  <TileLoop />
{...}
```
