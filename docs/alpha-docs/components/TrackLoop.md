# TrackLoop

The TrackLoop component loops over tracks. It is for example a easy way to loop over all participant camera and screen share tracks. Only tracks with a the same source specified via the sources property get included in the loop. TrackLoop creates a TrackContext for each track that you can use to e.g. render the track. Further narrowing the loop items is possible by simply filtering the returned array.

## Usage

```tsx
const tracks = useTracks([Track.Source.Camera]);
<TrackLoop tracks={tracks} >
 <TrackContext.Consumer>
   {(track) => track && <VideoTrack {...track}/>}
 </TrackContext.Consumer>
<TrackLoop />
```
