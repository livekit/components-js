# TrackLoop

The TrackLoop component loops over tracks. It is for example a easy way to loop over all participant camera and screen share tracks. Only tracks with a the same source specified via the sources property get included in the loop. Further narrowing the loop items is possible by providing a filter function to the component.

## Usage

```tsx
{...}
  <TrackLoop sources=[Track.Source.Camera, Track.Source.ScreenShare]>
    {...}
  <TrackLoop />
{...}
```
