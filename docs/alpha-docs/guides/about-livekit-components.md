# About LiveKit Components

LiveKit Components give you a declarative way to build your real-time LiveKit audio/video frontend app with React.

Every use case is different and apps in the real world are individual and unique. We don't pretend to have the perfect solution that fits all use cases. Instead, we've taken an approach where we give you reasonable defaults, but give you full control over each component if you want it.

We offer a set of easy-to-use components with the possibility to customise and design them according to your needs. We provide you with all the necessary building blocks to build a live video and audio app in no time. All components are carefully crafted and take care of LiveKit state management for you.

Many components come with variations so you can choose what look fits your app the best. On top of that there is a global theme to LiveKit Components so you can easily adjust the theming to your needs.

## Philosophy

- Close to the metal: Because most of the components are merely wrappers around standard HTML-Elements you can overwrite the basic component style how ever you want.

- Sane defaults with room to grow: Get started quickly with our ready-made-components or use them as a stepping stone to bootstrap your own.

## Create your own components

The component we offer does not fit your requirements? We have the solution for you! Each component comes with its own React hook, which you can use to create your own component with minimal boilerplate. Of course you can also combine your own component with our pre-built components. It's common to start with our components to quickly sketch out a concept, and then replace some of them with your own components to build something we could never have imagined.
