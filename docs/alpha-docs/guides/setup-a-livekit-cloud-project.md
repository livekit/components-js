# Cloud Project Setup

Short guide to show you how to setup a project and generate a user access token with LiveKit Cloud

---

A LiveKit app consists of two parts:

- The user-facing frontend, for example your web app that you can build with LiveKit Components (this package :P).
- The backend server, which is responsible for user authentication and, of course, for managing and distributing all the video and audio data sent and received by your frontends.

For your frontend to work properly, you need a LiveKit backend. For simplicity, we will use [LiveKit Cloud](https://livekit.cloud) as the backend server in the following example.
Of course, if you already have a LiveKit server, you can use that to create your user access token. In this guide, we will use the hosted LiveKit Cloud solution. LiveKit Cloud has a generous free plan and is easy to use. If you want to join, visit [cloud.livekit.io](https://livekit.cloud) and sign up for a free plan (no credit card required).

### Create LiveKit Cloud backend

After registration, create a new project – name it whatever you want.

#### Generate access token

In your created project navigate to `Settings` > `Keys`, there you should see a key with the name of `Autogenerated`.

As the name indicated this key was autogenerated for you on project creation – thank you! Let's utilize it by clicking `Generate Token`. A modal like in the picture below should appear.

Just to clarify. This manual process of generating a user access token is normally done automatically by the server SDK, we only do this for testing purposes.
Fill out the `Generate token` form by adding whatever username and room name you like. You don't have to modify the permissions, the defaults are perfectly fine.
I increased the value in the time to live (TTL) field to 28800 (which converts to 8 hours). Hit `Generate` to generate a new access token and copy the generated token we are going to need it in a bit.

### Server URL

Still in your LiveKit project, navigate to `Settings` > `Project` and copy the server URL for later use.

With the server URL and user access token, you now have everything you need to connect to the LiveKit Cloud backend from your front end.
