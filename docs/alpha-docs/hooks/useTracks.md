# useTracks

The useTracks hook returns Array<TrackParticipantPair> which combine the track and the corresponding participant of the track. Only tracks with a the same source specified via the sources property get included in the loop. Further narrowing the loop items is possible by providing a `filter` function or setting the `excludePinnedTrack` property.

## Usage

```ts
const pairs = useTracks({sources: [Track.Source.Camera], excludePinnedTracks: false})
```
