# useVisualStableUpdate

The useVisualStableUpdate hook tries to keep visual updates of the TackBundles array to a minimum, while still trying to display important tiles such as speaking participants or screen shares.  Updating works with pagination. For example, if a participant starts speaking on the second page, they will be moved to the first page by replacing the least active/interesting participant on the first page.
