# LiveKitRoomProps.serverUrl property

URL to the LiveKit server. For example: `wss://<domain>.livekit.cloud` To simplify the implementation, `undefined` is also accepted as an intermediate value, but only with a valid string url can the connection be established.

**Signature:**

```typescript
serverUrl: string | undefined;
```
