## LiveKitRoomProps.token property

A user specific access token for a client to authenticate to the room. This token is necessary to establish a connection to the room. To simplify the implementation, `undefined` is also accepted as an intermediate value, but only with a valid string token can the connection be established.

**Signature:**

```typescript
token: string | undefined;
```
