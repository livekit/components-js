# ParticipantLoop variable

The ParticipantLoop component loops over an array of participants to create a context for every participant. This component takes exactly one child component as a template. By providing your own template as a child you have full control over the look and feel of your participant representations.

**Signature:**

```typescript
ParticipantLoop: ({ participants, ...props }: ParticipantLoopProps) => React.JSX.Element;
```

## Remarks

If you want to loop over individual tracks instead of participants, you can use the `TrackLoop` component.

## Usage

```tsx
const participants = useParticipants();
<ParticipantLoop participants={participants}>
  <ParticipantName />
<ParticipantLoop />
```
